About Me

Hello! I'm **Joseph Severe**, a software engineer and researcher passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence and accessibility. I specialize in creating AI and NLP tools that transform data into solutions that educate, inform, and empower. I also like extracting and manipulating data to retrieve significant insights and create an impact with that information.
